**Crowd Simulator**

An interactive crowd simulation application built in Unreal Engine 5 as part of a bachelorâ€™s thesis at CTU Prague. The simulator allows users to generate diverse agents (by age, gender, and behavior), configure environments, and run scenarios such as normal pedestrian flow or emergency evacuation.

Key features:

- Agent-based simulation with configurable crowd parameters

- Custom navigation and avoidance system for realistic movement

- Interactive UI for adding/removing agents and switching scenarios

- Supports visualization of evacuation dynamics and crowd behavior patterns

Technologies: *Unreal Engine 5, C++, Blueprints, AI Behavior Trees, Agent-based modeling*
